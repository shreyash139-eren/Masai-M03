    <h1>Software Development</h1>
    <h2>Front-End</h2>
    <p>In software development, the front end refers to the part of an application or website that users see and interact with directly. It's the user-facing layer, responsible for the look and feel of the application. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this interactive interface.</p>
    <h3>Back-End</h3>
    <p>In software development, the "back end" refers to the server-side logic, database management, and all the processes that occur behind the scenes of a website or application that users don't directly interact with. It's the engine that powers the application, handling data processing, user requests, and communication with databases. 
        </p>
        <h4>Full-Stack</h4>
        <p>A "full stack" refers to both the front-end (user-facing) and back-end (server-side) components of a software application. A full stack developer is proficient in both, able to handle everything from the user interface to the server-side logic. This means they can build and maintain entire applications, from the front-end design to the back-end database and server logic. <br><br>
